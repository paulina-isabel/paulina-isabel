I was recently enrolled in Turing School of Software and Design's Front End Software Development program, and graduated on November 17th, 2023!<br>
During my time at Turing, I learned and implemented technologies brand new to me through building applications both alone and in teams. Implementing my existing team collaboration, strategic planning, problem-solving, communication, and people skills to use in this new way has proven to be exciting and fulfilling. I've seen how software can impact the world and am excited to contribute to something innovating.<br>
Looking forward to keep learning and expand my skills to their fullest potential!
