I'm currently enrolled in Turing School of Software and Design's seven month long Front End Software Development program.<br>
During my time at Turing so far, I've learned to utilize my existing skills in a new exciting way through building applications both alone and in teams.<br>
Implementing my team collaboration, strategic planning, problem-solving, communication, and people skills to use in this new way has proven to be exciting and fulfilling.<br>
Excited to keep learning and expand my skills to their fullest potential!
